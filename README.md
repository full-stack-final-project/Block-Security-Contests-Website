## Contributions

We both discussed, designed and drew the ER diagram. 

Yihua Hu: SQL codes for creating 4 tables. Developed: `init()` in `userDAO.java`, `rootPage()` routing function in `ControlServlet.java`. ALL class/.java `user.java`, `contestant.java`, `judge.java`, `sponsor.java`. The last three class are  inherited from class user. ALSO implemented a python script `generate_data.py` to generate `fake_data.txt` which we use to initialize the database. This python script and fake_data.txt are also in the zip file under folder `Block-Security-Contests-Website`. 

Junhao Qiu: SQL codes for creating 4 tables. Developed: `insert()`, `checkWalletAddress()`(check if the passing wallet_address exists in database) in `userDAO.java`. `login()` and `signup()` functions in `ControlServlet.java`. And also two jsp file for front end: `mylogin.jsp`, `signuppage.jsp`.
